# A/B Test: Software Free Trial Length (7-day vs 14-day)

Primary question: Does giving users more time to experience the product increase paid conversion and lifetime value?

Objective:

Determine whether a 14-day free trial (Variant B) produces higher paid conversion and better LTV than a 7-day free trial (Variant A), without substantially worsening acquisition quality or increasing abuse.
